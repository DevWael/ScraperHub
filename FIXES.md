# Web Scraper Dashboard - Fixes Applied

This document outlines the fixes applied to address the identified issues in the web scraper dashboard.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Download Link Issue ✅
**Problem**: Download functionality was referenced but the API endpoint didn't exist.

**Solution**: 
- Created `/app/api/scraper/download/[id]/route.ts` endpoint
- Added proper zip file creation using the `archiver` package
- Created organized directory structure: `data/tasks/` for task outputs and `data/downloads/` for zip files
- Added utility functions for directory management and file operations

### 2. Progress Percentage Issue ✅
**Problem**: Progress bar showed 50% when it reached 100%.

**Solution**:
- Fixed progress calculation in `TaskCard.tsx` using `Math.min(task.progress, 100)`
- Created `calculateProgress()` utility function to ensure progress is always between 0-100
- Updated progress bar to show for both running and completed tasks
- Added bounds checking to prevent progress from exceeding 100%

### 3. Task Deletion Issue ✅
**Problem**: Deleting tasks was always failing.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `deleteTask` function in `app/page.tsx` to make proper API calls
- Updated `/app/api/tasks/[id]/route.ts` to properly import the database instance
- Added proper error handling and user feedback
- Ensured proper deletion order to avoid foreign key constraint issues

### 4. Code Testability and Reusability ✅
**Problem**: Code was not easily testable and had duplicated logic.

**Solution**:
- Created `lib/utils.ts` with reusable utility functions
- Added comprehensive test suite in `lib/utils.test.ts`
- Implemented Jest configuration for testing
- Added proper mocking for external dependencies
- Created utility functions for:
  - URL validation and formatting
  - Progress calculation
  - Status management
  - File operations
  - Time calculations
  - Task management

## New Features Added

### Directory Structure
```
data/
├── tasks/          # Task output directories
├── downloads/      # Downloadable zip files
└── scraper.db      # SQLite database
```

### Utility Functions
- `isValidUrl()` - URL validation
- `formatUrlForDisplay()` - URL formatting for UI
- `calculateProgress()` - Progress bounds checking
- `getStatusColor()` - Status color classes
- `getStatusText()` - Status text display
- `calculateEstimatedTime()` - Time estimation
- `parseProgressData()` - Progress data parsing
- `canDownloadTask()` - Download availability check
- `createZipFromDirectory()` - Zip file creation
- `cleanupOldTasks()` - File cleanup utility

### Testing Infrastructure
- Jest configuration with Next.js support
- Comprehensive test coverage for utility functions
- Mock setup for external dependencies
- Test scripts: `npm test` and `npm run test:watch`

## API Endpoints

### New Download Endpoint
- `GET /api/scraper/download/[id]` - Download task results as zip file
- Validates task completion and output existence
- Creates compressed zip files for easy download
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Dependencies Added
- `archiver` - For creating zip files
- `jest` - For testing framework
- `@types/jest` - TypeScript definitions for Jest
- `jest-environment-jsdom` - DOM environment for testing

## Code Quality Improvements

### Reusability
- Extracted common logic into utility functions
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Standardized API response formats
- Modular component structure

### Testability
- Pure functions for business logic
- Proper separation of concerns
- Mockable external dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Maintainability
- Clear function documentation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Error boundary implementation

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Downloading Task Results
- Click the download button on completed tasks
- Files are automatically zipped and served
- Downloads are stored in `data/downloads/` for caching

### Progress Monitoring
- Real-time progress updates via Socket.IO
- Accurate progress percentage display
- Estimated time remaining calculations

## Future Improvements

1. **Performance**: Implement file streaming for large downloads
2. **Security**: Add authentication and authorization
3. **Monitoring**: Add task cleanup scheduling
4. **UI/UX**: Add progress animations and better error states
5. **Testing**: Add integration tests for API endpoints
